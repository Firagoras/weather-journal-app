## Overview

This project is an asynchronous web app that uses Web API (Open Weather API) and user inputs to dynamically update the User Interface.

## Development

The project is created using NodeJS which is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, and ExpressJS which is a minimal Nodejs web application framework. Vanilla JavaScript is used in the app front end.

## Purpose

The app is the third project of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. The project was created to meet specific requirements set by Udacity. Some improvements and new features may come soon.

## Specification
